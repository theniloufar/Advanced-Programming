## üìÅ Project 1: Class Schedule

### Description
The **Class Schedule** program creates an optimized weekly timetable for courses by considering teacher availability, course timings, and specific constraints. It ensures that no teacher is double-booked and all courses are scheduled appropriately.

### Key Features
- **Teacher & Course Management**: Handles multiple teachers and courses.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Avoids overlapping schedules.
- **Sorting & Assignment**: Prioritizes courses alphabetically.

### How to Run
1. Compile the project using a C++ compiler.
2. Input:
   - Number of teachers and their availability.

## üìÅ Project 2: Place Visit Planner

### Description
The **Place Visit Planner** suggests an optimal visiting sequence for a list of places based on opening/closing times and priority ranks. It ensures maximum coverage within the available time.

### Key Features
- **Time Optimization**: Prioritizes places with higher ranks and longer availability.
- **Automatic Sorting**: Adjusts visiting order dynamically.
- **Detailed Itinerary**: Prints a complete visiting schedule.

### How to Run
1. Prepare an input CSV file with the following structure:
   ```
   name,openingTime,closingTime,rank
   PlaceA,08:00,17:00,1
   PlaceB,09:00,18:00,2
   ```
2. Compile the project using a C++ compiler.
3. Execute the program:
   ```
   ./PlaceVisitPlanner <input_file.csv>
   ```
4. Output: A suggested visit schedule.
